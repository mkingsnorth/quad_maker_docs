---------------------------------
What is Quad Maker?
---------------------------------

Quad Maker is a set of edit mode tools for 3D modelers that enables quick and efficient retopologizing of existing objects into quads. These tools are designed to work with each other to provide a faster retopology workflow than Blender's default, while seamlessly integrating with Blender's existing toolset.

The Tools
---------------------------------


- **Place Points \[Click\]** - Pland ahead by placing vertices onto a target surface ready to fill with quads.
- **Fill Quads \[Hold F + Click + Drag\]** - A tool that fills in quads between points, edges and holes in the geometry.
- **Extrude Edges and Create Faces \[Hold E and Click + Drag\]** - A tool that extrudes edges and creates faces between points.
- **Quickly Loop Cut and Slide \[Hold R + Click\]** - Just by hovering the mouse over an edge and clicking the mouse.
- **Draw Quad Strips \[Hold D and Click + Drag\]** - Click and move the mouse across the mesh to create a strip of quads.
- **Delete Faces, Edge Loops and lone Vertices \[Hold X and Click + Drag\]** - Quickly click and drag over a mesh to delete elements.
- **Smooth Elements \[Hold S and Click + Drag\]** - Relax vertices whilst maintaining their projection onto the target surface.
