Frequency Asked Questions

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The *New Object with Quad Maker* option is greyed out.  Why?
-----------------------------------------

Make sure you have an object selected in Object Mode before trying to use this option.  If you have an object selected in Edit Mode, the option will be greyed out.

-----------------------------------------
Can I change the keyboard shortcuts?
-----------------------------------------

Unfortunately at the moment the keyboard shortcuts have to be hard coded into the add-on for Blender.  This is something we are looking to change in the future.
